##Installation##

 - Use django-dev version. This project uses some snapshot features provided in latest django releases. 
 - Go to the django project directory `web_interface`.
 - Run `./manage.py syncdb --noinput`. This loads the default data into the database from the initial data json dump.
 - User - Pass: admin - admin, test - test.

##Development##

 - Currently the evaluator queuing system (will use celery in future), wont be included, so use some dummy stuff for working this out.
